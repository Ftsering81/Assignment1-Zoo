	<p> 
		Gloria is a female hippopotamus. Hippopotamuses are the third largest type of land mammal after elephants and rhinoceros. They are also semiaquatic and spend up to 16 hours a day submerged in rivers or lakes to keep their large bodies cool. They are good swimmers and can hold their breath underwater for up to five minutes. Gloria is a sweet and a confident hippopotamus. She is friends with Alex the lion, Marty the zebra, and Melman the giraffe.

		The number of Hippopotamuses like Gloria in the wild is decreasing and they are classified as vulnerable to extinction. The main threat facing hippopotamuses in the wild is being hunted by humans for their meat and ivory tusks.
