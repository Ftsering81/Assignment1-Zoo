		Alex is a male African lion. He was born on an African wildlife reserve and was named Alakay. He was captured as a cub by poachers, but the crate he was contained in fell into a river and eventually floated to New York, where we found him and took him in. He enjoys his life at the zoo and has plently of friends. His best friend is Marty the zebra.

		The number of African lions like Alex in the wild is declining and they're now classified as vulnerable to extinction. The main threat facing African lions in the wild is being killed by trophy hunters.
